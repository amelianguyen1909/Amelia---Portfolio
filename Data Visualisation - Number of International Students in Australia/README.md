ABOUT THIS PROJECT
-

This project is a Data Visualisation about the changes in number of international students in Australia from 2012 to 2021 using Tableau, and then I looked specifically
into Macquarie University's case. I compiled the dataset from the **Australian Department of Education**
(https://www.education.gov.au/international-education-data-and-research) and **THE World University Ranking 2021**
(https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2021/world-ranking). The data/information I have used include:
* World University Rankings: Ranking, University Name, University Location (Country), Percentage of International Students.
* Total number of international students from 2012 to 2021.
* Education-related travel export from 2012 to 2021.
* Number of commencing international students in different Australian states from 2012 to 2021.
* Number of international students in each Broad Field of Education from 2012 to 2021.
* Number of international students in each University in Australia from 2012 to 2021.

FINDINGS
-

* Australia is one of the countries in the world with the highest education quality. Furthermore, it is also a country which is very welcoming towards accepting
international students.
* Generally, the number of international students in Australia has **increased** over the period 2012-2021. However, Australia has also seen a relatively sharp shrink in
the international student cohort from 2019 to 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
* In 2021, China, India, Nepal, Vietnam and Malaysia are the 5 most popular countries of origin, among which **China and India** account for almost **HALF** of the
international student cohort.
* **NSW, VIC and QLD** are the top 3 destinations in Australia for international students. These 3 states also saw the sharpest decrease in the number of international
students when the COVID-19 pandemic struck. Among the remaining states, **SA** has seen the highest growth in the number of international students, indicating an
increasing trend of international students choosing this state as their destination for education.
* In 2021, **Business, IT, Society and Culture, and Engineering** are the Fields of Education with the largest international student cohort, constituting almost **75%**
of all international students in Australia. **IT** has the highest annual growth in the number of international students, which coincides with the technological boom over
the past decade. Although the **Business** cohort is the largest among them all, it has seen a very slow growth over the past decade.
* Compared to Australia, NSW and other universities in Sydney (University of Sydney, UNSW, UTS, Western Sydney University), the number of international students overall
**decreased** from 2012 to 2021 for Macquarie University. Compared to the aforementioned entities, the number of **Business international students** has also
**decreased** for Macquarie University, while the growth in the number of **IT international students** has **increased** significantly, which probably indicates a
shift in the overall goal and vision of the University in international student recruitment and acceptance.
