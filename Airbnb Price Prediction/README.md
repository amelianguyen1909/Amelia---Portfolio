ABOUT THIS PROJECT
-

In this project, I aim to predict the prices for Airbnb listings in Melbourne by building a Machine Learning model using Python.

HOW TO USE THIS REPOSITORY
-

There are 6 files in this repository:

* `Airbnb_Price_Prediction.ipynb` : Python file containing details of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Cleaning, New Variable Creation, and the Machine Learning model.
* `neighborhood_test.csv` : CSV file containing all of the cleansed neighborhood for the test dataset
* `neighborhood_test.csv`: CSV file containing all of the cleansed neighborhood for the train dataset.
* `pred_forest.csv`: CSV file containing predictions using Random Forest model.
* `pred_xgb.csv`: CSV file containing predictions using XGBoost model.
* `predictions_MLP.csv` : CSV file containing predictions using Neural Network model.

All of the data (train dataset and test dataset) can be found in the `data` folder.
